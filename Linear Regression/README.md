Ed Hopkins over at the Wisconsin State Climatology Office (http://www.aos.wisc.edu/~sco/) maintains a listing of the dates and durations of full-freeze ice covers on our dear Madison lakes, Mendota and Monona, found here (http://www.aos.wisc.edu/~sco/lakes/Mendota-ice.html) . This data goes back to the mid-1800s, thanks to handwritten records in some very old log books (they're behind glass in Ed's office over in AOS).
Analyzing this data is an interesting exploration in the changes in our local climate over time, so let's use some machine learning techniques to take a look at the data.
